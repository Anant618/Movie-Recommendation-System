# ðŸŽ¬ AI Movie Recommender System

This AI-powered movie recommender system is built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn. It leverages a TF-IDF vectorizer and Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend similar movies based on plot summaries. The system uses a cleaned dataset of over 100000 Hollywood movies from 1980 to 2024, containing details like title, genre, language, runtime, and IMDb rating. Users can simply input a movie title and instantly receive personalized recommendations based on content similarity.

The app is developed to run locally on macOS with a simple Streamlit interface. To get started, clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run `streamlit run app.py`. The project is modular and ready for future enhancements such as user login/signup, watch history, and mobile deployment via Flutter. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to build an intelligent and interactive movie recommendation engine.
